# ClassSearch2.0
This is CSUN COMP 490 team 4's second Senior Design project.

We are implementing a more advanced class search for students at CSUN. This a server-based, mobile-responsive web application that is designed by and for Millennials.
We are placing the user experience at the forefront, putting Agile/Scrum methodologies into practice.
We are leveraging existing JSON-based web services and data sets from http://api.metalab.csun.edu.
This web application can be easily extended to for other Universities if desired.

With this project, we are hoping to address the following issues:
Academic Data typically exists for users, but:
  - UI/UX design are severely lacking.
  - Data needs to be accessed increasing via a mobile platform.
  - The experience needs to be more convenient for the user.
